Data Scientist,Wave,"London, England",£149K(Employer Est.),"Our missionWe're making Africa the first cashless continent.In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments.

Data Scientist,Wave,"London, England",£149K(Employer Est.),"Our missionWe're making Africa the first cashless continent.In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards.

Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere.

Data Scientist,Wave,"London, England",£149K(Employer Est.),"Our missionWe're making Africa the first cashless continent.In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave.

Data Scientist,Wave,"London, England",£149K(Employer Est.),"Our missionWe're making Africa the first cashless continent.In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards.

Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave.
