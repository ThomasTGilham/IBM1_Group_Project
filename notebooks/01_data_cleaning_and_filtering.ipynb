    "\n",
    "* How to do it: For each row in your Glassdoor data, generate a random date between April 1, 2025, and June 21, 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pros:\n",
    "* Far more realistic than the midpoint approach. It reflects that postings were spread out over time.\n",
    "* Avoids creating an artificial spike, leading to more natural-looking time series plots.\n",
    "* Preserves the total number of jobs within the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cons:\n",
    "* The dates are still synthetic (an educated guess). The true distribution might not have been uniform (e.g., more jobs get posted on Mondays).\n",
    "* Introduces randomness. You must set a random seed to ensure your results are reproducible every time you run the script.\n",
    "  \n",

    "### Step 5: Handling Missing Salary Data in Uni-provided Adzuna Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology for Handling Missing Salary Data\n",
    "Given that approximately 60% of the uni-provided Adzuna listings lack salary data, a robust imputation strategy is required to avoid significant data loss and selection bias. We are proceeding with **Grouped Median Imputation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This methodology involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stratification**: The dataset is stratified into distinct cohorts based on primary salary predictors: Job Title and Location (Region).\n",
    "2. **Median Calculation:** The median salary is calculated for each *(Job Title, Region)* cohort using the records where salary data is present. The median is chosen over the mean for its robustness to outliers within each group.\n",
    "3. **Imputation:** Missing salary values are then populated with the calculated median of their respective cohort.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Justification:\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is superior to a single global median as it preserves the inherent variance in compensation across different roles and geographic markets. It provides a reasonable and defensible estimate by leveraging the strongest available predictors in the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for cohorts that may lack any salary data, a fallback hierarchy is implemented: first imputing by ***Job Title*** median alone, and finally by the global median if necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures completeness while maintaining the highest possible level of specificity at each step. This method provides a reliable foundation for subsequent feature engineering and analysis without introducing the confounding complexities of a full predictive model at the preprocessing stage."

    "## Data Preparation and Methodology *(for final write-up)*\n",
    "The objective of the data preparation phase was to consolidate multiple datasets into a single, analysis-ready master file. This required a systematic approach to handle inconsistencies in data structure, harmonize temporal data, and address significant volumes of missing salary information. The following methodology was implemented to ensure the final dataset was both complete and methodologically robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Consolidation and Provenance\n",
    "The first step involved merging three distinct datasets: df_pengjin_adzuna, df_uni_adzuna, and df_tom_glassdoor. To maximize the statistical power of subsequent steps, the datasets were consolidated before any imputation was performed. This approach ensures that the calculation of descriptive statistics (such as medians for imputation) is based on the largest possible sample size, leading to more stable and reliable estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, a source column was added to each dataset prior to merging. This preserves data provenance, allowing for clear traceability of each record to its origin. This is a critical step for ensuring transparency and enabling future analysis to compare or control for variations between data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Temporal Data Harmonization\n",
    "A significant challenge was the absence of posting dates in the Glassdoor dataset, contrasted with the historical data from Adzuna dating back to 2019. To prepare the data for time series analysis, the following steps were taken:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Imputation of Missing Dates: For the Glassdoor listings, which were known to be from a two-month window in 2025, dates were imputed by assigning a random uniform date within that known period. This avoids the creation of an artificial data spike on a single day and reflects the reality that postings were distributed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Creation of 'Year' Column: A Year column was derived from the posting date of every record. This column is the cornerstone of the time-aware imputation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Missing Salary Data Imputation\n",
    "A substantial portion of the consolidated dataset (~60%) lacked salary information. Simply deleting these records would have drastically reduced the dataset's size and introduced significant selection bias, as the factors that lead to a salary being listed are non-random. Therefore, a multi-tiered imputation strategy was employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1. Rationale for Grouped Imputation\n",
    "Instead of using a single global median, which would obscure significant market variations, a grouped median imputation strategy was chosen. This method operates on the principle that compensation is primarily a function of role, geography, and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2. A Time-Aware, Multi-Tiered Strategy\n",
    "To account for wage growth and inflation, the imputation was made time-aware by including the Year as a primary grouping variable. This ensures that a missing 2019 salary is only informed by other 2019 salaries. A multi-level fallback system was designed to maximize data retention while maintaining the highest possible specificity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Level 1 (Most Specific): Missing salaries were first imputed using the median of their specific (Year, Job Title, Region) cohort.\n",
    "2. Level 2 (Fallback): If a Level 1 cohort had no salary data, imputation was performed using the median of the broader (Year, Job Title) group.\n",
    "3. Level 3 (Final Fallback): For any remaining missing values, the median of the corresponding Year was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median was chosen over the mean for its robustness to outliers within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3. Justification for Geographic Granularity\n",
    "The Region was chosen for geographic grouping over the City due to data quality considerations. The Region data was clean and consistent, whereas the City data contained variations that would have fragmented the cohorts. Using Region creates larger, more statistically stable groups, providing more reliable medians for imputation while still capturing major economic differences across the UK.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Methodological Safeguards\n",
    "To ensure analytical transparency, an is_salary_imputed boolean flag was created for every record before the imputation process began. This flag allows for a clear distinction between original and imputed data points. Its presence is critical for conducting a sensitivity analysis, whereby the final analytical results can be compared between the full, imputed dataset and the subset of records with original salary data. This step validates the imputation strategy and quantifies its impact on the final conclusions."
